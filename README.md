# Simple Beam
A basic beam bending analysis package, intended to do very simply beam bending moment & shear force analysis. The method used is McCauley's method, and the implementation is based on SymPy's beam analysis module, just more nicely wrapped for every day usage.

This is primarily intended to be a proof of concept package for me - at this point it is not a robust means for doing your engineering analysis.

Users should be familiar with basic structural mechanics and standard engineering practices such as doing independent checks of tools you take from the internet, if they intend to use this for anything in the real world.
